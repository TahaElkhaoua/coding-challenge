# Front-end Coding Challenge
## Getting started

Our simple app will be retieving repositories data from github and structuring
it using React for the UI.

    Building our app functionality will go through the following Steps :
        * Retrieving JSON data from github : [X]
        * Filtering Data into a list of components : [X]
        * Formatting components ( Adding a repositorie template for each repo) : [X]
        * Adding stylesheets to render a beautiful UI : [X]

## Libraries used 

Our app has simple functionality therefor won't be needing a lot of libraries, and 
they can be summed into the following :

    - Basic React Libraries and react-router-dom : to handle HTTP requests.
    - axios : to handle fetch requests (the use of axios is a personal preference
     Javascript Fetch could also be used).
    - react-icons : for rendering custom UI icons. 

# HOW TO RUN PROJECT

    All you have to do to run our App is clone the project using the following command :
        git clone git@github.com:TahaElkhaoua/coding-challenge.git

    or the download the zip file from github
    run : npm install
    Navigate to app directory and run : npm start

Have a wonderful experience ðŸ‘½
